Q4,01:53.0,113,Foul: Offensive,Brook Lopez,LeBron James,IC,"LHH and LATR show James (CLE) applies a forearm with a bent elbow to Lopez (BKN) in the lower defensive box, which is legal. James then hooks Lopez’s arm from underneath and Lopez reacts by clamping James’ arm with his left off arm / hand and a double foul should be called. However, the slot sees only Lopez’s action and calls an offensive foul The lead referee has a dual whistle at this point, seeing the two players arms wrapped up. On plays in the paint, all three referees have responsibility to help with contact, and when two or three referees make a call, they are trained to make eye contact and the official who takes control of the play tweets multiple whistles to indicate he has the play. In this case, the referee who thought he had the best look was incorrect based on the angles available. We should have a double foul with BKN retaining possession.",http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0021500240&eventNum=536,20151128BKNCLE,20151128BKNCLE-0,BKN,CLE,20151128,Derrick Collins,Scott Foster,Derek Richardson,,88,90,L2M-BKN-CLE-11-28-15.pdf,https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201511280CLE.html,CLE,BKN
