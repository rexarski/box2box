Q4,00:02.8,2.8,Other,,,IC,"Curry (GSW) signals for a timeout after Thompson (GSW) secures the ball, but it is not acknowledged by officials. The trail official acknowledges the timeout request from Golden State's head coach at the 0:01.8 mark after Thompson has already dribbled. Because Thompson dribbled prior to the timeout being granted, the clock should not have been reset and Golden State should not have had the option to advance the ball to the 28' hash mark upon resumption of play. The ball should have been inbounded on the sideline where play was interrupted with 0:01.8 remaining on the clock. Golden State should have had to request an additional timeout in order to advance the ball in this situation, but they did not have any timeouts remaining.",http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0021500583&eventNum=1312,20160113GSWDEN,20160113GSWDEN-9,GSW,DEN,20160113,Kevin Cutler,Eric Lewis,Kevin Scott,,110,112,L2M-GSW-DEN-1-13-16.pdf,https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/201601130DEN.html,,
